# APEX: Alloy Property EXplorer using simulations

[APEX](https://github.com/deepmodeling/APEX) (Alloy Property EXplorer using simulations) is a part of [AI Square](https://aissquare.com/) project, in which we refactored the [DP-Gen](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dpgen) `auto_test` module to construct an extensible general alloy property test Python package. It allows users to construct a variety of property-test workflows easily using different computational methods (e.g. LAMMPS, VASP, and ABACUS are supported currently).- [APEX: Alloy Property EXplorer using simulations](#apex-alloy-property-explorer-using-simulations)

## 1. Overview

`APEX` inherits the functionality of the second version of alloy properties calculations and is developed based on the [dflow](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow) framework. By incorporating the advantages of cloud-native workflows, `APEX` simplifies the complex process to automatically test multiple configurations and properties. It offers users an more intuitive and easy-to-use interaction, making the overall user experience more straightforward.

The overall architechture of `relaxation` and `property-test` workflows follows the similar **three-steps** style of previous codes:

## 2. Easy Install
